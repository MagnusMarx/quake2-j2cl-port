Google's J2CL/HTML5 port of Bytonic Software's Java port of Id Software's Quake II

1) run com.googlecode.gwtquake.tools.Installer from the server module
2) copy baseq2 from war to server/src/main/webapp/
3) gwt-nio isn't merged yet, so you have to clone and install it locally from https://github.com/treblereel/gwt-nio
4) for multiplayer you need to set ws server addr at client/src/main/java/com/googlecode/gwtquake/client/CompatibilityImpl.java:62
   copy files from config folder to ~/.jake2
5) run mvn clean package
6) deploy to wildfly

known issues:

*    build tested only in openjdk version "1.8.0_252"
*    it's not possible to join multiplayer game if server behide the NAT (maybe just my issue)
*    mouse key bindings work not properly
*    minor sound issues
*    poor code quality (original code has been generated from C )
*    it's not possible to set server address as param

Enjoy and file the bugs :)
